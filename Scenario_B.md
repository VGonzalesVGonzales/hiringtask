Hi Jane,

Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear that you were ineligible to join our program. We will be happy to provide you more clarification.

While we recognize the time and effort you put together to complete your pre-work application, we are sorry that we are unable to move forward with your enrollment at this time.

Codepath, as you know, is a non-profit organization and offers classes based on our current sponsorship's requirements. At the moment, we are only able to extend our courses to students who are enrolled in our partner universities within the United States.

Jane, we understand that the pre-work can be tedious and we really are impressed by your commitment to improve yourself. With that, I will send you the guide that our learners will use. I will also provide you the link to some videos you can watch so that you can learn more about the topic.

1. [Intro to Mobile Product Development](https://info.codepath.org/mobile-product-development)
2. [Mobile Development Step by Step Guide](https://blog.codepath.org/mobile-product-development/)
3. [Mobile Development Tutorial - Video 1](https://youtu.be/uQx6UJ881IY)
4. [Everything You Need to Know About Mobile Development Video 2](https://www.my-mooc.com/en/mooc/introduction-mobile-application-hkustx-comp107x-1/)

We hope that you find these valuable. We are confident that these will help you become more knowledgeable about Mobile Product Development.

Also, rest assured that if we open programs to students outside the United States, we will definitely let you know. We have done it before in Taiwan and we hope to do it again in the future.

Meanwhile, enjoy your learning and we wish you the best in your ventures.

Kind regards, 

Codepath.org Team
