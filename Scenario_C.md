## Scenario C: Applicant who Missed the Deadline

Hi Anne, 

Thank you for your interest in our Summer Interview Prep Course. We will be happy to assist and provide you further information.

We received your intent to enroll in the class last February 8th. However, our deadline for application was set last January 25th. As much as we want to admit you, we are sorry that we can't due to the class being full and having a long waitlist.

We understand that you are graduating this Spring (Congratulations in advance!). We acknowledged how important preparation is for a graduating student so allow us to share our [high-level software interview guide](http://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguide) which contains tips and guidelines that would help you ace your interviews.

We also recommend that you go over our website's [resources](https://codepath.org/career) to further your knowledge on some topics that might be touched during your internship interview. Likewise, please consider signing up for our [mailing list](https://codepath.org/career#) to be updated on our future courses or virtual events that may help you become truly ready post graduation.

Anne, we are sad that we are unable to closely work with you in your preparation, but at the same time, we are excited for you to learn from the resources we have provided. In case you have questions, just send us a message and we will be happy to address them in the best way we can.

In the meantime, we cannot wait to see you thrive for your future and we wish you the best in your ventures.

Best regards,

Codepath.org Team
