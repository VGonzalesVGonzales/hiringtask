Hello Dennis,

Thank you for your interest in joining our Tech Fellow program. We are happy to check the status and provide you more details on your application.

Congratulations! We received your complete requirements last January 19th. Upon checking, everything looks great so rest assured that your application is good to go.

At this time, we are waiting on another eligible person from your school to apply so we can proceed with your admission. For your reference, it may take up to one month for us to find another person to pair you up with. Rest assured that we are doing our very best so we can set you up for success.

Dennis, we know that you are excited and we are, too! Thus, we challenge you to encourage your friends to join us so we can speed up the process. To allow you to provide them more details, please go over our [guidelines and requirements](https://info.codepath.org/spring-2021-tech-fellow-scholarship-program).

Also, here are [resources](https://codepath.org/career) you can review while we are waiting so you can get a headstart in this program.

Thank you for your patience. We will update you as soon as we are ready to move forward.

All the best,

Codepath.org Team
